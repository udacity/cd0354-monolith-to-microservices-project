# Udagram Image Filtering Application

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into two parts:
1. Frontend - Angular web application built with Ionic Framework
2. Backend RESTful API - Node-Express application

Navigate to the project directory, and set up the environment variables again:

```js
source set_env.sh
```
